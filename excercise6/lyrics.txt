Code Monkey think someday have everything eventhing even pretty girl like you
code monkey just waiting for now
Code Monkey say someday, somehow 
much rather wake up, eat a coffee cake
take bath, take nap
thi job "fulfilling in the creative way"
Such a load of crap 

Code Monkey have long walk back to cubicle he sit down to pretend to work
Code Monkey not thinking so straight
Code Mondkey not feeling so great

Code Monkey hang around at front desk
Tell you sweater look nice
Code Monkey offer buy you soad
Bring you cup, bring you ice

Rob say Code Monkey very diligent
But his output stink
His code not "functional" or "elegant"
What do Code Monkey think?

Code Monkey get up get coffee
Code Monkey go to job
Code Moneky have boring meeting
With boring manager Rob:wwq:
