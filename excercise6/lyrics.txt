You say no thank you for the soda cause 
Soda make you fat
Anyway you busy with the telephone
No time for chat

Code Monkey have every reason
To get out this place
Code Monkey just keep on working 
See your soft pretty face

Code Monkey like Fritos
Code Monkey like Tab and Mountain Dew
Code Monkey very simple man
With big warm fuzzy secret heart:
Code Monkey like you
Code Monkey like you

Code Monkey think maybe manager want to write god damned login page himself
Code Monkey not say it out loud
Code Monkey not crazy, just proud
Code Monkey have long walk back to cubicle he sit down to pretend to work
Code Monkey not thinking so straight
Code Mondkey not feeling so great

Code Monkey hang around at front desk
Tell you sweater look nice
Code Monkey offer buy you soad
Bring you cup, bring you ice

Rob say Code Monkey very diligent
But his output stink
His code not "functional" or "elegant"
What do Code Monkey think?

Code Monkey get up get coffee
Code Monkey go to job

With boring manager Rob:wwq:
